ingredients for panner butter masala
 Paneer – cut into cubes. If using frozen paneer, make sure you dip the paneer in warm water until it’s completely thawed and softs. Don’t immerse it for long, or it will start disintegrating during cooking. 

» Butter – use unsalted. This way, you can control the sodium content in the paneer curry. Don’t cut back on butter as it is the star ingredient of our recipe and adds great flavor. 

» Onions – I have used 2 medium-sized white onions. Feel free to use red onions as a substitute.

» Ginger + Garlic – for a boost of flavor, always use fresh. I have used sliced ginger and garlic. However, you can use ginger and garlic paste instead. 

» Cashew nuts – this is where our dish gets its creamy texture. If you are allergic to nuts, then swap cashews for an equal amount of cream or half and half. 

» Tomatoes – Use ripe tomatoes as they give a beautiful color to our paneer curry. 

» Tomato paste – don’t skip this. Concentrated store-bought tomato paste lends the butter masala a rich, creamy texture. 

» Whole spices include a bay leaf, cinnamon, black cardamom, green cardamom, and cloves. 

» Spices – Kashmiri Red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric, garam masala powder, and salt. 

» Kasoori methi- a must-have ingredient. Always crush the dried methi leaves in between your palms before adding them to any curry. This crushing releases the aroma and flavor of Kasoori methi. 

» Oil – It’s added along with butter to prevent it from burning during cooking.  Feel free to use any oil you prefer. Olive oil, avocado oil tastes equally good. 

» Sugar – a little bit to balance all that tanginess from the tomatoes. Do not skip sugar as you need a little something to neutralize the sourness of the tomatoes. Feel free to use honey as a substitute. 

» Cream – for that luscious, velvety restaurant-style paneer butter masala texture, use any cream with 35% fat content or more. 

The slight sweetness of onions + the tanginess from the ripe tomatoes + richness of butter and cashews, the subtle aroma of the spices lends a deliciously deep flavor to this dish. Finally, Kasoori methi’s addition is what takes this paneer butter masala to a whole new level. It’s like Indian food at its best!
